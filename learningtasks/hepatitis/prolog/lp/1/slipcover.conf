; (values: integer, default value: 10, valid for SLIPCOVER): number of interations of beam search
max_iter=2

; (values: {bottom,mode}, default value: bottom) specialization mode.
;specialization=bottom

; (values: given, cw, default value: cw): if set to given, the negative examples in testing are taken from the test folds interpretations, i.e., those examples ex stored as neg(ex).
; If set to cw, the negative examples are generated according to the closed world assumption, i.e., all atoms for target predicates that are not positive examples. 
; The set of all atoms is obtained by collecting the set of constants for each type of the arguments of the target predicate.
