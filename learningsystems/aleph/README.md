# Aleph

## Description

[Aleph](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machinelearning/Aleph/) -- **A** **L**earning **E**ngine for **P**roposing 
**Hy**potheses is an ILP system written in Prolog. It comprises several algorithms and requires an installed
[YAP system](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/).

## Installation

To be able to use Aleph an installed [YAP](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/downloads.html) system is required.
There are YAP software packages for the most common Linux distributions as well als binary and source distributions
on the [YAP web page](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/downloads.html). In any case you should make sure that the YAP
executable is in your `$PATH`.

The actual Aleph implementation is provided as a single file available at
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/aleph.pl .
After downloading the `aleph.pl` file it should be moved to `SML-Bench/learningsystems/aleph`.
