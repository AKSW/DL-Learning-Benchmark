# TopLog

## Description

TopLog is part of the [_General Inductive Logic Programming System_ (GILPS)](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jcs06/GILPS/)
developed by [Jos√© Carlos Almeida Santos](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jcs06/).
GILPS is written in Prolog and requires at least [YAP 6.0](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/downloads.html).
TopLog makes use of [Top Directed Hypothesis Derivation](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/Papers/toplog.pdf) to learn Prolog theories.

## Installation

To make use of the GILPS an installed [YAP](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/downloads.html) system is required.
There are YAP software packages for the most common Linux distributions as well as binary and source distributions
on the [YAP web page](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/downloads.html). In any case you should make sure that the YAP
executable is in your `$PATH`.

Having installed YAP, the actual GILPS can be downloaded at http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jcs06/GILPS/GILPS.tar.bz2 .
The tar archive contains the GILPS Prolog sources which need to be extracted to `SML-Bench/learningsystems/toplog`.
The directory should then contain at least the following files:

```bash
SML-Bench/learningsystems/toplog $ ls -F
Makefile  README.md  run*  source/  validate*
```

No further steps are required. In particular there is **no** need to call `make`.
