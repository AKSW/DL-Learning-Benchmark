# STILE
Step-by-Step to the Best Machine Learning Algorithms from Structured Data

**Description**

STILE is a *S*truc*t*ured Mach*i*ne *L*earning B*e*nchmark. It provides datasets, which contain structured knowledge (beyond plain feature vectors) in languages such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) or the logic programming language Prolog. For those datasets, STILE defines a number of machine learning tasks, e.g. the prediction of diseases. 

**Mission**

The ultimate goal of STILE is to foster research in machine learning from structured data as well as increase the reproducibility and comparability of algorithms in that area. This is important, since a) the preparation of machine learning tasks in that area involves a significant amount of work and b) there are hardly any cross comparisions across languages as this requires data conversion processes.
